== Installation ==
= General Requirements =
* PHP: 7.4 or newer

= WordPress Requirements =
* WordPress: 5.9 or newer

= bbPress Requirements =
* bbPress Plugin: 2.6.2 or newer

= Basic Installation =
* Plugin folder in the WordPress plugins folder must be `gd-bbpress-tools`
* Upload folder `gd-bbpress-tools` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where can I configure the plugin? =
Open the Forums menu, and you will see Tools item there. This will open a panel with global plugin settings.

= Will this plugin work with old, standalone bbPress (versions 1.x) installation? =
No. This plugin requires the plugin versions of bbPress 2.6.2 or higher.

= Click on Quote button doesn't add quoted content? =
This happens if the plugin's JavaScript is not loaded. Make sure that both CSS and JavaScript options are enabled. If that doesn't help, make sure to enable 'Always Include' option too.

= Sometimes quoted content when saved appears broken? =
The quote itself doesn't strip HTML, but bbPress does. If the quoted section contains HTML tags or tag attributes that bbPress doesn't allow, it will strip them when the reply is saved. To solve that, you need to use the option to control allowed HTML tags in topics and replies.

= Some features not working with BuddyPress group forums? =
This happens if the plugin's JavaScript is not loaded. Make sure that both CSS and JavaScript options are enabled and 'Always Include' option is also enabled.

= Does this plugin work with bbPress and BuddyPress groups? =
GD bbPress Tools 3.1 is tested with BuddyPress 6.0 using bbPress for Groups forums. Make sure you enable JavaScript and CSS Settings Always Include option in the plugin settings.

= Some BuddyPress features break when I use BuddyPress Nuovo templates? =
The problem is caused by the Italic BBCode due to the conflict with the Underscore templates system BuddyPress uses. You can disable Italic BBCode, or you can limit BBCodes to the bbPress content only (highly recommended).

= When the quote is used on the formatted content, formatting will be gone inside displayed quote? =
This happens because quoting can only take rendered HTML as is, and when saved, bbPress will remove some HTML elements based on the user role. [GD bbPress Toolbox Pro](https://www.dev4press.com/plugins/gd-bbpress-toolbox/) plugin includes additional features that expand the allowed HTML elements for all roles, and that solves this quote problem.
